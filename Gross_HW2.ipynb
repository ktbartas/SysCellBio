    "HW#1 simulated a single kinesin stepping, ignoring load and ATP, by having “steps” occur with constant probability. You assumed kinesin takes 8 nm steps, with no back-steps, and has some probability of detaching per step, and tuned things to get the appropriate mean velocity and run-length. You made a histogram of run-lengths. Now we’ll look at velocities.  \n",
